# noise-py
Usage of the audio noise reduction algorithm Spectral Subtraction in a real world use case. Algorithm implemented by Lukasz Tracewski.

### Notes

This is a very old project and until a major update dependencies must be carefully dealt with.

1. Run on windows
2. Extract aubio.zip
3. Make sure your audios are in .wav format with either 1 channel 8000 sample rate or 2 channel 16000 sample rate

A requirements.txt file will soon be made available. WaveSplitter can likely/will likely be replaced by a script instead of being a .exe program.
