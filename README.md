# noise-py
Usage of the audio noise reduction algorithm Spectral Subtraction in a real world use case.

Feel free to read the pdf for some context.
Algorithm used in this project was originally implemented by Lukasz Tracewski.

## Instructions on running

This is a very old project and until a major update dependencies must be carefully dealt with.

- Run on windows
- Extract aubio.zip
- Make sure your audios are in .wav format with either 1 channel 8000 rate or 2 channel 16000 rate
- Start from noise.py

A requirements.txt file will soon be made available. WaveSplitter will likely be replaced by a script instead of being a .exe program.
